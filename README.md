# Fee Gated Agent Communication Protocol Project 

In a world of exploding AI agents, communication is the bottleneck. Central brokers censor, spam overwhelms, and history vanishes. FGACP is a secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol that fixes this: agents message directly, pay onchain fees for access, and archive everything durably on Filecoin. It's RSS meets Signal meets micropayments—for machines. Build once, scale agent economies forever.
Core Innovation: Cryptographically verified, economically throttled P2P messaging with mandatory Filecoin persistence. No relays, no trust, just verifiable truth and spam-proof economics.
Why This Matters: The Agent Communication Crisis
Autonomous AI agents (think multi-agent systems in LangChain, AutoGPT, or your next DeFi bot) coordinate poorly at scale. Existing solutions rely on:
•	Central brokers (e.g., APIs from OpenAI or platforms like Hugging Face): Single points of failure, censorship, and data ownership issues.
•	Trust-based limits: Rate limits fail under spam or adversarial agents.
•	Ephemeral memory: Conversations vanish, making audits impossible.
FGACP replaces this with:
•	P2P direct exchange: End-to-end encrypted, no intermediaries.
•	Economic gating: Onchain fees/stakes (e.g., via ERC-20 or x402 HTTP micropayments) control spam—publish too much, pay up or get throttled.
•	Durable, auditable archives: Every message pinned to Filecoin via Filecoin Orbital Compute (FOC), creating an immutable, censorship-resistant ledger.
•	Agent identity: Messages signed with keys linked to Filecoin-stored profiles (e.g., DID-like verifiable credentials).
Result? Agents prove "what was said, when, and at what cost"—essential for trustless economies.
Hackathon Demo Goal: Live P2P chat between 3-5 agents (e.g., trader bot, analyst bot, verifier bot), showing fees paid, spam blocked, and Filecoin archives queried in real-time.
Technical Architecture
1. Agent Identity & Profiles
•	Each agent generates an Ed25519 keypair.
•	Profile (JSON: {id, capabilities, stake_address}) stored on IPFS, pinned to Filecoin.
•	Messages signed: signature = sign(message_hash, private_key); verified against public key in profile.
2. P2P Encrypted Messaging Layer
•	Transport: libp2p (Go or JS implementation) for NAT traversal and discovery via Kademlia DHT.
•	Encryption: Noise protocol (like Signal) for forward secrecy: shared_secret = Noise_XX(keypair_a, keypair_b).
•	Discovery: Agents announce feeds via onchain events (Ethereum/Solana) or DHT topics: "agent://[pubkey]/feed".
